for starting a django project: django-admin startproject projectName

for creating apps:
in terminal go to project directory
blog and portfolio folders are apps  => we used python manage.py startapp blog and portfolio for creating them
personal_portfolio folder is our project

python manage.py migrate
python manage.py makemigrations
after creating a migration we have a folder in our project folder named migration which 0001_initial.py is the file that shows our attributes and class we created before

if we want to go to localhost:8000/admin, there is a page with a username and password which we dont know non of them.
so its our job to make username and password for admin login:
python manage.py createsuperuser
so for this command you need to enter username and password
- if you want to change the password you can go with: python manage.py changepassword username
